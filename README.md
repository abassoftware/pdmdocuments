# pdmDocumentsCo
This is the source code of pdmDocumentsCo, an abas Essentials App build on the abas Essentials SDK.

## General setup
If you are using proxies, add a gradle.properties file to your $GRADLE_USER_HOME.

```
#If you use a proxy add it here
systemProp.http.proxyHost=<webproxy>
systemProp.http.proxyPort=<port>
systemProp.https.proxyHost=<webproxy>
systemProp.https.proxyPort=<port>
```

Run `./initGradleProperties.sh` in your terminal (use Git Bash on Windows)

Use your favorite IDE to import the project.

## Installation
To install the project make sure you are running the docker-compose.yml file
or else change the gradle.properties file accordingly to use another erp client
(you will still need a nexus server, but it can of course also be installed in your erp installation
or elsewhere as long as it is configured in the gradle.properties file).

To use the project's docker-compose.yml file, in the project's root directory run:
```shell
docker login --username <extranet user> --password <extranet password> sdp.registry.abas.sh
docker-compose up
```

Now you can install the project as follows:
```shell
./gradlew fullInstall
```
## Development
If you want to make changes to the project before installing you still need to run the docker-compose.yml file
or at least have a Nexus Server set up to work with.

Then run
```shell
./gradlew publishHomeDirJars
```

You also need to run
```shell
./gradlew publishClientDirJars
```
to upload the $MANDANTDIR/java/lib dependencies to the Nexus Server and set your IDE up to work with the uploaded dependencies.

After that the code should compile both with gradle and in your IDE and you are set up to work on the code or resource files as you want.
